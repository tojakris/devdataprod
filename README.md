## Part0: Regression Models Course Project  
> **Context**
You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:
> * “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
> * “Quantifying how different is the MPG between automatic and manual transmissions?”

> **Question**  
Take the `mtcars` data set and write up an analysis to answer their question using regression models and exploratory data analyses.

> **Your report must be:**  
* Written as a PDF printout of a compiled (using knitr) R markdown document.
 * Do not use any packages that are not in R-base or the library datasets.
* Brief. Roughly the equivalent of 2 pages or less for the main text. Supporting figures in an appendix can be included up to 5 total pages including the 2 for the main report. The appendix can only include figures.
* Include a first paragraph executive summary.

### Executive Summary: 
There is a set of variables related to miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome).

Here the difference of the MPG between automatic and manual transmissions is focused, 
the `mtcars` dataset in car package is taken as the data source, 
and techniques about regression models is used to solve the following two questions:

* “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
*  “Quantifying how different is the MPG between automatic and manual transmissions?”

## Part1: Shiny Application  
> 
1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3. Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

> **The application must include the following:**  
1. Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
2. Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
4. You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
5. The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.

Done and deployed in shinyapps.io:

## Part2: Reproducible Pitch Presentation  
> OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide)  to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify with an html5 slide deck.

> **Here's what you need**  
* 5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify
* Your presentation pushed to github
* A link to your github presentation pasted into the text box below

> **Your presentation must satisfy the following**  
* It must be done in Slidify
* It must be 5 pages
* It must be on github
* It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document

Done and deployed in Github:
